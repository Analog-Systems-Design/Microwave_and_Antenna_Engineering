        <h1>Microwave Introduction</h1>
        Microwave devices are devices that work at high range of frequencies of 4 Ghz till ..GHz, 
        <h2>Matching Networks</h2>
        <h3>Old Concept of Matching</h3>
        <p>
        The main principle of matching network we have already passed through it while studying thevenin when you 
        were trying where we proved that to find maximum power transfer we found that load impedance must be equal to
        conjugate of source impedance
        </p>

            <img src="images/matching.JPG"/>
            <figcaption>Matching Impedance</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Why choosing source impedance =50ohms?</h3>
        <p>
        what limits power on wave guide is it will melt which we call it breakdown, we found that max power is at impedance
        of 30 ohms and min losses at 75 ohms in case we are using a coaxial cable air-filled so we take geometric mean 
        of both quantities which equals 50ohms which is a standard that we usually use in antennas, filters,....and
        all microwave devices
        </p>

        <h3>Matching using Lumped Components for a resistive load</h3>
        <p>
            we are trying to find matching network using lumped elements elements so we found that we have two options whether
            to use resistive matching where its pros that we are not limiting bandwidth range of the source but its cons that
            it will consume much power we are not using it as it doesn't go to the load while if we use LC-Components we will
            be limited by a certain bandwidth range but ideally we won't lose much power, what we mean by lumped components is
            it has fixed dimensions that we cannot control.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/matchingnetworkpros.JPG"/>
            <figcaption>Matching Network pros/cons</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            After solving equations in order to find value for values of matching network component parameters in case you
            are using resistive network it will be equal to geometric mean of load resistance and source resistance but 
            in case we are using LC-components then we will have two cases when load resistance is larger than source resistance
            and when it is smaller like in image below where \(r_L ={ R_{load} \over R_{source} }\). where solving equation
            is done by getting \(Z_{in}\) equation and equating it with \(R_S\) so we will have two equations, one for real
            and one for imag. and solving them to find L,C values

            positive reactance ====> inductive<br/>
            negative reactance ====> Capacitive<br/>
            positive susceptance ====> inductive<br/>
            negative susceptance ====> Capacitive

        <p>
            In communication systems when we are sending data we need to modulate the carrier signal with the message so when we
            are sending the transmitted signal we don't have only the carrier signal tone we have a certain bandwidth that was defined
            by the message when it was modulated at the carrier tone so when we design matching we need not to consider only the carrier
            tone but we need also to consider message bandwidth
